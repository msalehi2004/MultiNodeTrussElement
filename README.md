# Continuous Multi-Node Truss Element

This is a repository for the source codes associated with the implementation of the *continuous multi-node truss element formulation* in [OpenSees](https://github.com/OpenSees/OpenSees). 

The continuous multi-node truss element formulation enables simulation of a continuous cable/rope/wire with angular deviations while maintaining a uniform axial strain/force over its entire length. To this end, this element mormulation allows discretizing the cable/rope/wire into multiple truss sub-elements with arbitrary directions, though all these sub-elements are represented via a single multi-node element formulation and have idential axial strain/force. Both two- and three-dimensional versions of the formulation have been implemented and both use *co-rotational* geometric transformations to capture through-analysis changes to the length/direction of the truss sub-elements.

## Tcl Command

Command:
    
    element multiNodeTruss $eleTag? $nodeTags? $matTag? $A?

Arguments:

*  $eleTag    unique element object tag (integer)
*  $nodeTags  node tags from start to end (integer)
*  $matTag    uniaxial material tag (integer)
*  $A         cross-sectional area (double)

Example:

The following example constructs a multi-node truss element of tag **1** with three sub-elements connecting nodes **2**, **3**, **4**, and **5** with a constant area of **2.5** and a uniaxial material tag of **6**:
